                        <p>Glutamine (symbol Gln or Q) is an α-amino acid that is used in the biosynthesis of
                            proteins. Its side chain is similar to that of glutamic acid, except the carboxylic acid
                            group is replaced by an amide. It is classified as a charge-neutral, polar amino acid. It is
                            non-essential and conditionally essential in humans, meaning the body can usually synthesize
                            sufficient amounts of it, but in some instances of stress, the body's demand for glutamine
                            increases, and glutamine must be obtained from the diet. It is encoded by the codons
                            CAA and CAG.
                        </p>
                        <p>In human blood, glutamine is the most abundant free amino acid.</p>
                        <p>
                            The dietary sources of glutamine includes especially the protein-rich foods like beef,
                            chicken, fish, dairy products, eggs, vegetables like beans, beets, cabbage, spinach,
                            carrots, parsley, vegetable juices and also in wheat, papaya, Brussels sprouts, celery, kale
                            and fermented foods like miso.
                            In 2017, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved L-glutamine oral powder,
                            marketed
                            as Endari, to reduce severe complications of sickle cell disease in people aged five years
                            and
                            older with the disorder.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The safety and efficacy of L-glutamine oral powder were studied in a randomized trial of
                            subjects ages five to 58 years old with sickle cell disease who had two or more painful
                            crises
                            within the 12 months prior to enrollment in the trial. Subjects were assigned randomly to
                            treatment with L-glutamine oral powder or placebo, and the effect of treatment was evaluated
                            over 48 weeks. Subjects who were treated with L-glutamine oral powder experienced fewer
                            hospital visits for pain treated with a parenterally administered narcotic or ketorolac
                            (sickle
                            cell crises), on average, compared to subjects who received a placebo (median 3 vs. median
                            4),
                            fewer hospitalizations for sickle cell pain (median 2 vs. median 3), and fewer days in the
                            hospital (median 6.5 days vs. median 11 days). Subjects who received L-glutamine oral
                            powder
                            also had fewer occurrences of acute chest syndrome (a life-threatening complication of
                            sickle
                            cell disease) compared with patients who received a placebo (8.6 percent vs. 23.1 percent).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Common side effects of L-glutamine oral powder include constipation, nausea, headache,
                            abdominal
                            pain, cough, pain in the extremities, back pain and chest pain.

                            L-glutamine oral powder received orphan drug designation. The FDA granted the approval of
                            Endari to Emmaus Medical Inc.

                            Synephrine, or, more specifically, p-synephrine, is an alkaloid, occurring naturally in some
                            plants and animals, and also in approved drugs products as its m-substituted analog known as
                            neo-synephrine. p-Synephrine and m-synephrine
                            are known for their longer acting adrenergic effects compared to epinephrine and
                            norepinephrine. This substance is present at very low concentrations in common foodstuffs
                            such as orange juice and other orange (Citrus species) products, both of the "sweet" and
                            "bitter" variety. The preparations used in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), also known as
                            Zhi Shi, are the immature and dried whole oranges from Citrus aurantium (Fructus Aurantii
                            Immaturus). Extracts of the same material or purified synephrine are also marketed in the
                            US, sometimes in combination with caffeine, as a weight-loss-promoting dietary supplement
                            for oral consumption.

                            orange), collected in China, were reported to contain synephrine levels of about 0.1–0.3%,
                            or
                            ~1–3 mg/g; Analysis of dried fruit of C. aurantium grown in Italy showed a concentration
                            of
                            synephrine of ~1 mg/g, with peel containing over three times more than the pulp.

                            found to contain ~13–34 μg/g (corresponding to 13–34 mg/kg) synephrine (with roughly equal
                            concentrations in juice and separated pulp); from these results, it was calculated that

                            one "average" Tarocco orange would result in the consumption of ~6 mg of synephrine.

                            samples from France, Italy, Spain, or Lebanon, showed synephrine levels ranging from 0.05

                            Synephrine has been found in marmalade made from Citrus unshiu (Satsuma mandarin) obtained
                            in Japan, at a concentration of ~0.12 mg/g (or about 2.4 mg/20g serving). Most of the orange
                            marmalades made in the US are produced using "sweet" oranges (C. sinensis), whereas "bitter"
                            or
                            Seville oranges (C. aurantium) are used for making the more traditional, bitterer marmalades

                            roughly 360 mg/L), while in juice products obtained from a Satsuma mandarin variety grown in
                            California, levels of synephrine ranged from 55 to 160 mg/L .

                            Juices from "sweet" oranges purchased in Brazilian markets were found to contain ~10–22 mg/L
                            synephrine; commercial orange soft drinks obtained on the Brazilian market had an average
                            synephrine content of ~1 mg/L. Commercial Italian orange juices contained ~13–32 mg/L of

                            Protein is needed to gain muscle mass. There are different types of protein supplements,
                            each
                            with its own unique properties. Protein that is absorbed quickly should be consumed
                            immediately
                            upon awakening, as well as after training. Slow-absorbing protein should be taken at
                            bedtime.
                            When using whey protein, you will be getting about ten percent of the immune globulin
                            protein
                            that is intact. This means that this protein has two pairs of polypeptide chains. Although
                            it
                            may be too confusing for the average person to understand what this property of protein
                            means to
                            you. To put it simply, that your muscles receive exactly those amino acids, that is, what
                            the
                            protein consists of, which give growth to your muscles.

                            BCAAs
                            as whey protein. You must consume these amino acids because you will actually lose them as
                            your
                            muscles grow. Most people don't realize that muscle damage is severe during exercise, but
                            whey
                            protein essentially replaces whatever muscle loses during and after exercise. This is the
                            great
                            benefit of protein. Whey protein also helps detoxify the body by helping the body produce
                            more
                            endogenous glutamine. Protein is also beneficial in helping to make your immune system
                            strong.
                            And this is another useful property of protein. You may wonder how body builders train so
                            much
                            day in and day out without muscle soreness. In fact, beginners often stop exercising after
                            the
                            first two workouts, simply because they cannot tolerate pain. Here's another benefit of whey
                            protein.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Whey protein chains contain four essential amino acids that also act as natural pain
                            relievers. Overall, whey protein has many beneficial properties that are very important for
                            building muscle because our bodies use it better than any other type of protein. Read about
                            what
                            protein is useful for us in the previous article. But like everything else, there are
                            disadvantages to whey protein. First, the best proteins on the market are quite expensive,
                            making them unaffordable for most people who find themselves in the training gym. There are
                            proteins that are affordable, but they are usually of much lower quality and are often full
                            of
                            sugar. Plus, these cheaper foods don't digest as easily as quality protein. In general,
                            however,
                            the most serious bodybuilders will look for a good protein, as there are so many benefits in
                            protein, while the disadvantages usually only include the cost of the product. Simply put,
                            you
                            can't get by with whey protein if you're serious about bodybuilding. When you look at how
                            much
                            protein is useful for building muscle, it seems ludicrous that it was once considered a
                            waste
                            product in the production of milk and cheese.
